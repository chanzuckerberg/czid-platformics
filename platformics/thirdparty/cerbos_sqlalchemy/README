This folder contains modified code from the [cerbos-sqlalchemy](https://github.com/cerbos/query-plan-adapters/tree/815ab0cd16f8e9d1eb16b2a14d34fea2b46d70df/sqlalchemy/src/cerbos_sqlalchemy) package.

The code was modified to support our use of SQLAlchemy's table polymorphism feature. For example, `Sample` inherits `Entity`'s fields, and sqlalchemy handles joining between those tables, but the package tries to join an additional time, which causes errors.

This is the diff:

<                     "', '".join(required_tables)
<                 )
<             )
```

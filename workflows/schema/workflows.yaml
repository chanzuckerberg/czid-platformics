    # NOTE - the LinkML schema doesn't support a native "plural name" field as far as I can tell, so
    # we're using an annotation here to tack on the extra functionality that we need. We do this because
    # English pluralization is hard, and we don't want to have to write a custom pluralization function.
    # This basically means we now have our own "dialect" of LinkML to worry about. We may want to see if
    # pluralization can be added to the core spec in the future.
